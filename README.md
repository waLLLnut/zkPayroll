# Mezcal

Mezcal (Nahuatl: mexcalli - agave booze) - on-chain dark pool implementation using [Noir](https://noir-lang.org) and [Taceo coNoir](https://taceo.io). Hides EVERYTHING about orders and traders(tokens, amounts and addresses of traders are completely hidden). Trades settled on an EVM chain using a very simplified version of [Aztec Protocol](https://aztec.network). The tradeoff is O(N^2) order matching engine.

The code is highly experimental. The core code is located in `packages/contracts`.

> **Note**: This repository is a fork of the original Mezcal dark pool implementation. The zkPayroll demo below is built on top of the original dark pool infrastructure.

## zkPayroll

This repository includes a zero-knowledge payroll demo implementation built on top of the original Mezcal dark pool infrastructure. The demo showcases how the shielded pool technology can be applied to private payroll payments on Mantle Network.

See [zkPayroll.md](./zkPayroll.md) for documentation.

## Install coSnarks

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/TaceoLabs/co-snarks co-noir --rev 1b2db005ee550c028af824b3ec4e811d6e8a3705

## TODO

### contracts and circuits

- [x] split contract into a generic rollup and ERC20 specific
  - [x] extract PoolGeneric storage into a struct
- [x] join Erc20Note
- [ ] split Erc20Note
- [ ] negative tests
- [x] use bignumber for amounts
- [ ] support ETH
- [ ] fees
- [ ] prove against a historical note hash tree root
- [x] PublicInputsBuilder
- [ ] deploy as proxy
- [ ] test contracts with larger token amounts
- [ ] TODO(security): parse inputs to circuits instead of assuming they are correct. Same applies to types returned from `unconstrained` functions. <https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/issues/7181> <https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/issues/4218>
